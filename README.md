Additional Figures are in Figures/ folder (fully updated to reflect most recent model).

Code is in AstroMCAD.ipynb. The final model object is Trained_Model. This file is a pickle dump of a TrainedModel object, which is defined in the code, and has pretrained classification and anomaly scores for the training, validation, and testing dataset.
Email me if you'd like to see an updated version of the code.
